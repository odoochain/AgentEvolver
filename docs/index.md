title: Welcome to AgentEnvolver!
<!-- summary: Metadata configuration # subtitle -->

**AgentEvolver** is an end-to-end, self-evolving training framework that transforms the critical stages of agent training—task generation, trajectory exploration, and policy optimization—into an automated, closed-loop system driven by the LLM itself. By empowering agents to autonomously improve their capabilities, the framework aims for efficient, cost-effective, and continuous capability evolution.

## ✨ Key Features

- **High Efficiency Self Evolution**  
  Empowers agents to drive their own learning through **self questioning**, **self navigating**, and **self attributing**. These mechanisms enable automatic task generation, efficient exploration, and fine grained credit assignment, minimizing reliance on handcrafted datasets and manual training pipelines.

- **Broad Compatibility and Robust Adaptability**  
  Built on **gym-like environment service** and a **flexible context manager**, AgentEvolver integrates seamlessly with a wide range of environments and interaction patterns, from simple tool usage to complex multi turn reasoning.

- **Modular and Easily Extensible Architecture**  
  A clean, component based design decouples algorithms from infrastructure, making it simple to add new task generators, exploration strategies, experience modules, or training objectives for rapid research and customization.
